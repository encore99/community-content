## Introduction

This tutorial provides a detailed guide for setting up pfSense on Proxmox at Hetzner. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional pfSense firewall managing WAN, LAN, and DMZ networks in your virtualized environment. This guide assumes you have a dedicated Hetzner server with Proxmox VE installed and basic knowledge of virtualization and networking.

**Prerequisites**

To follow this tutorial, you will need:

- A Hetzner dedicated or cloud server.
  - Proxmox VE installed on the server via "installimage" (follow step 1 in the tutorial "[Install and Configure Proxmox VE](https://community.hetzner.com/tutorials/install-and-configure-proxmox_ve)")
  - A Hetzner configuration with an **additional IP and a separate MAC address**.
- Access to the Proxmox web interfaces.

**Example terminology**

- Main IP: `<10.0.0.1>`
- Additional IP: `<10.0.0.2>`
- Gateway: `<192.0.2.254>`
- Netmask: `255.255.255.224`
- Separate MAC Address: `<00:50:56:00:76:3E>`

## Step 1 - Configure Proxmox Networking

Open the `/etc/network/interfaces` file on your Proxmox host:

```bash
nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

Add the following configuration:

```plaintext
# Loopback interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# Physical interface without IP
auto enp41s0
iface enp41s0 inet manual

# WAN Bridge
auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet static
    address <10.0.0.1>
    netmask 255.255.255.224
    gateway <192.0.2.254>
    bridge_ports enp41s0
    bridge_stp off
    bridge_fd 0

# LAN Bridge
auto vmbr1
iface vmbr1 inet static
    address 192.168.1.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    bridge_ports none
    bridge_stp off
    bridge_fd 0

# DMZ Bridge
auto vmbr2
iface vmbr2 inet static
    address 192.168.2.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    bridge_ports none
    bridge_stp off
    bridge_fd 0
```

Apply the changes by restarting the network service:

```bash
systemctl restart networking
```

## Step 2 - Set Up the pfSense VM in Proxmox

### Step 2.1 - Create a New VM
1. Open the Proxmox web interface.
2. Create a new virtual machine:
   - **ISO**: Use the pfSense ISO.
   - **Network Interfaces**:
     - WAN: Connect to `vmbr0`.
     - LAN: Connect to `vmbr1`.

### Step 2.2 - Install pfSense
1. Boot the VM from the ISO and follow the installation steps.
2. Assign interfaces:
   - WAN: `em0` (linked to `vmbr0`).
   - LAN: `em1` (linked to `vmbr1`).

### Step 2.3 - Access the Web Interface
Connect to the LAN (`192.168.1.0/24`) and access the pfSense GUI:

```
http://192.168.1.1
```

Default credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `pfsense`

## Step 3 - Configure pfSense Networking

* Configure WAN Interface
  
  Go to `Interfaces` > `WAN`.
  
  Set the following:
  - IP Address: `<10.0.0.2>`
  - Netmask: `255.255.255.224`
  - Gateway: `<192.0.2.254>`
  - MAC Address: `<00:50:56:00:76:3E>`

<br>

* Enable DHCP for LAN
  
  Go to `Services` > `DHCP Server`.
  
  Enable DHCP for the LAN interface.
  
  Set an IP range:
  - Start: `192.168.1.100`
  - End: `192.168.1.200`

## Step 4 - Adjust Firewall Rules

* Allow LAN Traffic
  
  Go to `Firewall` > `Rules` > `LAN`.
  
  Add a rule:
  - Action: Pass
  - Source: LAN subnet
  - Destination: Any
  - Protocol: Any

<br>

* Adjust WAN Rules
  
  Restrict WAN access to necessary ports only (e.g., for SSH or a web server).

## Step 5 - Test and Troubleshoot

* Verify Connectivity
  
  Run the following commands:
  ```bash
  ping <192.0.2.254>   # Test gateway
  ping 8.8.8.8         # Test external connectivity
  ```

<br>

* Common Issues
  - **No IP Address on LAN Clients**: Ensure the DHCP server is enabled for LAN.
  - **No Internet on WAN**: Verify that the MAC address is correctly set in Hetzner Robot.

## Conclusion

By completing this guide, you have:

1. Configured Proxmox networking for pfSense.
2. Installed and set up pfSense to manage WAN, LAN, and DMZ.
3. Enabled DHCP and firewall rules for your virtualized environment.

You are now ready to use your pfSense setup in a production environment.
